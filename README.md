  Keyboard implements keynote playback as midi sound. Included are volume control via ticked slider. 
  Also, found within the application window are options to change octave and instrument via drop down selection boxes. 
  Additionally, this keyboard has the interaction for storing notes played when recording which can be toggled via button. 
  Alongside the recording feature, is the playback; using stored notes from recording to play keynotes as they were given.
